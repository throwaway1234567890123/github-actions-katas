## Making "hello world"

Github Actions is configured through the YAML files. 
In order for us to make the first `hello world` script, examine the following example:

```yaml
name: hello-world
on: push
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: my-step
        run: echo "Hello World!"
```

The Github Actions config syntax is very straight forward. The trickiest part is typically indentation. Make sure your indentation is consistent. This is the single most common error in config. Letâ€™s go over the eight lines in details

* Line 1: The `name` attribute provides useful organizational information when returning warnings, errors, and output. The name should be meaningful to you as an action within your build process.
* Line 2: The `on` is the name of the GitHub event that triggers the workflow.
* Line 3: The `jobs` level contains a collection of arbitrarily named children.
* Line 4-5: The `my-job` is an example of the name for a job, `runs-on` describes on which operation system action should run. 
* Line 6-8: The `steps` collection is an ordered list of `run` directives. Each `run` directive is executed in the order in which it was declared.


# Task 
* Paste the example into `.github/workflows/hello-world.yaml`. Commit the file and push it to Github. Then, go to Github Actions and check the action status. 

You should see something like this in the logs of Github Actions: (Note: The logs can be a bit hard to the first time :-), but give it a shot)

```bash
#!/bin/sh -eo pipefail
echo 'Hello World!'

Hello World!
```
